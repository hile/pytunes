iTunes command line and python API
==================================

This module implements a wrapper for itunes appscript control and allows updating
library and playlists from command line.

There used to be a notification agent with itunesd but this has now been removed, as
itunes has it's own notifications.

This module uses apple script bridge and only works on OS X. No windows support is planned.
